# Mobile_app_Pszczolka
It is a copy of orginal private repository. The mobile application "Bee" is part of my engineering work. 

The application is designed for Android mobile devices using the Kotlin programming language and the FireBase platform responsible for data storage.

The application allows you to manage the activities of the beekeeper, such as: information about hives, inspections, treatment, amount of harvest, as well as expenses and income from running the apiary.
